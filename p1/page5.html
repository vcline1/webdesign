    <p>The general smiled. "I had no wish to go to pieces," he said. "I must do something. Now, mine is an analytical mind, Mr. Rainsford. Doubtless that is why I enjoy the problems of the chase."</p>
    <p>"No doubt, General Zaroff."</p>
    <p>"So," continued the general, "I asked myself why the hunt no longer fascinated me. You are much younger than I am, Mr. Rainsford, and have not hunted as much, but you perhaps can guess the answer."</p>
    <p>"What was it?"</p>
    <p>"Simply this: hunting had ceased to be what you call 'a sporting proposition.' It had become too easy. I always got my quarry. Always. <a id="bore"><b>There is no greater bore than perfection."</b></p>
    <p>The general lit a fresh cigarette.</p>
    <p>"No animal had a chance with me any more. That is no boast; it is a mathematical certainty. The animal had nothing but his legs and his instinct. Instinct is no match for reason. When I thought of this it was a tragic moment for me, I can tell you."</p>
    <p>Rainsford leaned across the table, absorbed in what his host was saying.</p>
    <p>"It came to me as an inspiration what I must do," the general went on.
    <p>"And that was?"</p>
    <p>The general smiled the quiet smile of one who has faced an obstacle and surmounted it with success. "I had to invent a new animal to hunt," he said.
    <p>"A new animal? You're joking."</p>
    <p>"Not at all," said the general. "<a id="joke"><b>I never joke about hunting</b>. I needed a new animal. I found one. So I bought this island built this house, and here I do my hunting. The island is perfect for my purposes--there are jungles with a maze of traits in them, hills, <a id="swamp1" href="page9.html#swamp2">swamps--</a>"</p>
    <p>"But the animal, General Zaroff?"</p>
    <p>"Oh," said the general, "it supplies me with the most exciting hunting in the world. No other hunting compares with it for an instant. Every day I hunt, and I never grow bored now, for I have a quarry with which I can match my wits."</p>
    <p>Rainsford's bewilderment showed in his face.</p>
    <p>"I wanted the ideal animal to hunt," explained the general. "So I said, 'What are the attributes of an ideal quarry?' And the answer was, of course, 'It must have courage, cunning, and, above all, it must be able to reason."'</p>
    <p>"But no animal can reason," objected Rainsford.</p>
    <p>"My dear fellow," said the general, "there is one that can."</p>
    <p>"But you can't mean--" gasped Rainsford.</p>
    <p>"And why not?"</p>
    <p>"I can't believe you are serious, General Zaroff. This is a grisly joke."</p>
    <p>"Why should I not be serious? I am speaking of hunting."</p>
    <p>"Hunting? Great Guns, General Zaroff, what you speak of is murder."</p>
    <p>The general laughed with entire good nature. He regarded Rainsford quizzically. "I refuse to believe that so modern and civilized a young man as you seem to be harbors romantic ideas about the value of human life. Surely your experiences in the war--"</p>
    <p>"Did not make me condone cold-blooded murder," finished Rainsford stiffly.</p>
    <p>Laughter shook the general. "How extraordinarily droll you are!" he said. "One does not expect nowadays to find a young man of the educated class, even in America, with such a na√Øve, and, if I may say so, mid-Victorian point of view. It's like finding a snuffbox in a limousine. Ah, well, doubtless you had Puritan ancestors. So many Americans appear to have had. I'll wager you'll forget your notions when you go hunting with me. You've a genuine new thrill in store for you, Mr. Rainsford."</p>
    <p>"Thank you, I'm a hunter, not a murderer."</p>
    <p>"Dear me," said the general, quite unruffled, "again that unpleasant word. But I think I can show you that your scruples are quite ill founded."</p>
    <p>"Yes?"</p>
    <p>"Life is for the strong, to be lived by the strong, and, if needs be, taken by the strong. <a href="index.html#hunters1" id="hunters2">The weak of the world were put here to give the strong pleasure</a>. I am strong. Why should I not use my gift? If I wish to hunt, why should I not? I hunt the scum of the earth: sailors from tramp ships--lassars, blacks, Chinese, whites, mongrels--a thoroughbred horse or hound is worth more than a score of them."</p>
    <p>"But they are men," said Rainsford hotly.</p>
    <p>"Precisely," said the general. "That is why I use them. It gives me pleasure. They can reason, after a fashion. So they are dangerous."</p>
    <p>"But where do you get them?"</p>
    <p>The general's left eyelid fluttered down in a wink. "This island is called <a id="shipTrap2" href=index.html#shipTrap1>Ship Trap</a>," he answered. "Sometimes an angry god of the high seas sends them to me. Sometimes, when Providence is not so kind, I help Providence a bit. Come to the window with <a href="page6.html">me</a>."</p>
