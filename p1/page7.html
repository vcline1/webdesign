    <p>General Zaroff did not appear until luncheon. He was dressed faultlessly in the tweeds of a country squire. He was solicitous about the state of Rainsford's health.</p>
    <p>"As for me," sighed the general, "I do not feel so well. I am worried, Mr. Rainsford. Last night I detected traces of my old complaint."</p>
    <p>To Rainsford's questioning glance the general said, "Ennui. Boredom."</p>
    <p>Then, taking a second helping of cr√¢pes Suzette, the general explained:"The hunting was not good last night. The fellow lost his head. He made a straight trail that offered no problems at all. That's the trouble with these sailors; they have dull brains to begin with, and they do not know how to get about in the woods. They do excessively stupid and obvious things. It's most annoying. Will you have another glass of Chablis, Mr. Rainsford?"</p>
    <p>"General," said Rainsford firmly, "I wish to leave this island at once."</p>
    <p>The general raised his thickets of eyebrows; he seemed hurt. "But, my dear fellow," the general protested, "you've only just come. You've had no hunting--"</p>
    <p>"I wish to go today," said Rainsford. He saw the dead black eyes of the general on him, studying him. General Zaroff's face suddenly brightened.
    He filled Rainsford's glass with venerable Chablis from a dusty bottle.</p>
    <p>"Tonight," said the general, "we will hunt--you and I."</p>
    <p>Rainsford shook his head. "No, general," he said. "I will not hunt."</p>
    <p>The general shrugged his shoulders and delicately ate a hothouse grape."As you wish, my friend," he said. "The choice rests entirely with you. But may I not venture to suggest that you will find my idea of sport more diverting than Ivan's?"</p>
    <p>He nodded toward the corner to where the giant stood, scowling, his thick arms crossed on his hogshead of chest.</p>
    <p>"You don't mean--" cried Rainsford.</p>
    <p>"My dear fellow," said the general, "<a href="page5.html#joke2" id="joke1">have I not told you I always mean what I say about hunting?</a> This is really an inspiration. I drink to a foeman worthy of my steel--at last." The general raised his glass, but Rainsford sat staring at him.</p>
    <p>"You'll find this game worth playing," the general said enthusiastically." Your brain against mine. Your woodcraft against mine. Your strength and stamina against mine. Outdoor chess! And the stake is not without value, eh?"</p>
    <p>"And if I win--" began Rainsford huskily.</p>
    <p>"I'll cheerfully acknowledge myself defeat if I do not find you by midnight of the third day," said General Zaroff. "My sloop will place you on the mainland near a town." The general read what Rainsford was thinking.</p>
    <p>"Oh, you can trust me," said the Cossack. "I will give you my word as a gentleman and a sportsman. Of course you, in turn, must agree to say nothing of your visit here."</p>
    <p>"I'll agree to nothing of the kind," said Rainsford.</p>
    <p>"Oh," said the general, "in that case--But why discuss that now? Three days hence we can discuss it over a bottle of Veuve Cliquot, unless--"</p>
    <p>The general sipped his wine.</p>
    <p>Then a businesslike air animated him. "Ivan," he said to Rainsford, "will supply you with hunting clothes, food, a knife. I suggest you wear moccasins; they leave a poorer trail. I suggest, too, that you avoid the big swamp in the southeast corner of the island. We call it <a href="page9.html#swamp3" id="swamp2">Death Swamp</a>. There's quicksand there. One foolish fellow tried it. The deplorable part of it was that Lazarus followed him. You can imagine my feelings, Mr. Rainsford. I loved Lazarus; he was the finest hound in my pack. Well, I must beg you to excuse me now. I always' take a siesta after lunch. You'll hardly have time for a nap, I fear. You'll want to start, no doubt. I shall not follow till dusk. Hunting at night is so much more exciting than by day, don't you think? Au revoir, Mr. Rainsford, au revoir." General Zaroff, with a deep, courtly bow, strolled from the room.</p>
    <p>From another door came Ivan. Under one arm he carried khaki hunting clothes, a haversack of food, a leather sheath containing a long-bladed hunting knife; his right hand rested on a cocked revolver thrust in the crimson sash about his waist.</p>
    <p>Rainsford had fought his way through the bush for two hours. "<span id="nerve1">I must keep my nerve</span>. <span id="nerve2">I must keep my nerve</span>," he said through tight teeth.</p>
    <p>He had not been entirely clearheaded when the chateau gates snapped shut behind him. His whole idea at first was to put distance between himself and General Zaroff; and, to this end, he had plunged along, spurred on by the sharp rowers of something very like panic. Now he had got a grip on himself, had stopped, and was taking stock of himself and the situation. He saw that straight flight was futile; inevitably it would bring him face to face with the sea. He was in a picture with a frame of water, and his operations, clearly, must take place within that <a class="nextpage" href="page8.html">frame</a>.</p>
