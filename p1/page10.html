    <p>"<a href="page7.html#nerve1">Nerve</a>, <a href="page7.html#nerve2">nerve</a>, <a href="page8.html#nerve3">nerve</a>!" he panted, as he dashed along. A blue gap showed between the trees dead ahead. Ever nearer drew the hounds. Rainsford forced himself on toward that gap. He reached it. It was the shore of the sea. Across a cove he could see the gloomy gray stone of the chateau. Twenty feet below him the sea rumbled and hissed. Rainsford hesitated. He heard the hounds. Then he leaped far out into the sea. . . .</p>
    <p>When the general and his pack reached the place by the sea, the Cossack stopped. For some minutes he stood regarding the blue-green expanse of water. He shrugged his shoulders. Then he sat down, took a drink of brandy from a silver flask, lit a cigarette, and hummed a bit from Madame Butterfly.</p>
    <p>General Zaroff had an exceedingly good dinner in his great paneled dining hall that evening. With it he had a bottle of Pol Roger and half a bottle of Chambertin. Two slight annoyances kept him from perfect enjoyment. One was the thought that it would be difficult to replace Ivan; the other was that his quarry had escaped him; of course, the American hadn't played the game--so thought the general as he tasted his after-dinner liqueur. In his library he read, to soothe himself, from the works of Marcus Aurelius. At ten he went up to his bedroom. He was deliciously tired, he said to himself, as he locked himself in. There was a little moonlight, so, before turning on his light, he went to the window and looked down at the courtyard. He could see the great hounds, and he called, <p>"Better luck another time," to them. Then he switched on the light.</p>
    <p>A man, who had been hiding in the curtains of the bed, was standing there.</p>
    <p>"Rainsford!" screamed the general. "How in God's name did you get here?"</p>
    <p>"Swam," said Rainsford. "I found it quicker than walking through the jungle."</p>
    <p>The general sucked in his breath and smiled. "I congratulate you," he said. "<a id="won"><b>You have won the game</b></a>."</p>
    <p>Rainsford did not smile. "I am still a beast at bay," he said, in a low, hoarse voice. "Get ready, General Zaroff."</p>
    <p>The general made one of his deepest bows. "I see," he said. "Splendid! One of us is to furnish a repast for the hounds. The other will sleep in this very excellent bed. On guard, Rainsford."</p>
